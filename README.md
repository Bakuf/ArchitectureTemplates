# ArchitectureTemplates

A collection of Xcode Templates for different architecture patterns to speed up development.

## Quick Start

To install the templates, copy the one that you want from the Templates folder to this path

‘~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/’

After that xcode should be able to recognize it when creating a new file in your projects.

Look at the example project to see how they work.
